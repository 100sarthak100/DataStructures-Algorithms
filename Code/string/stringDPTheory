subarrays/substring - 
A subbarray is a contiguous part of array. An array that is 
inside another array. For example, consider the array 
[1, 2, 3, 4], There are 10 non-empty sub-arrays. The subbarays 
are (1), (2), (3), (4), (1,2), (2,3), (3,4), (1,2,3), (2,3,4) 
and (1,2,3,4). In general, for an array/string of size n, 
there are n*(n+1)/2 non-empty subarrays/subsrings.

Subsequence (doesnot have to be contigious)
A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another 
sequence by zero or more elements, without changing the order 
of the remaining elements.
For the same example, there are 15 sub-sequences. They are 
(1), (2), (3), (4), (1,2), (1,3),(1,4), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), 
(1,2,3), (1,2,4), (1,3,4), (2,3,4), (1,2,3,4). 
More generally, we can say that for a sequence of size n, we 
can have (2^n-1) non-empty sub-sequences in total.
