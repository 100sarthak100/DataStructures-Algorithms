Microkernel in OS :
Kernel is the core part of an operating system which manages system resources. 
It also acts like a bridge between application and hardware of the computer. 
It is one of the first programs loaded on start-up (after the Bootloader).

Kernel mode and User mode of CPU operations :
The CPU can execute certain instruction only when it is in the kernel mode. 
These instruction are called privilege instruction.
They allow implementation of special operation whose execution 
by the user program could interface with the functioning of 
operating system or activity of another user program. 
For example, instruction for managing memory protection.

MicroKernel :
Microkernel is one of the classification of the kernel. 
Being a kernel it manages all system resources. But in a 
microkernel, the user services and kernel services are 
implemented in different address space. The user services are 
kept in user address space, and kernel services are kept under 
kernel address space, thus also reduces 
the size of kernel and size of operating system as well.

The microkernel is solely responsible for the most important 
services of operating system they are named as follows:

Inter process-Communication
Memory Management
CPU-Scheduling

Monolithic Kernel:
Monolithic Kernel is another classification of Kernel. Like 
microkernel this one also manages system resources between 
application and hardware, but user services 
and kernel services are implemented under same address space.
It increases the size of the kernel, thus increases size of operating system as well.

microvernel vs monolithic kernel :

microkernel is smaller in size.
It is larger than microkernel.

Only bare minimum code is placed inside the kernel (only basic memory management and Inter Process Communication code)
The entire O.S. is placed inside the kernel

Here the kernel is broken down into processes called as servers.
It runs as a single large process.

As services(Servers provide services) are separated they have different address spaces.
As all the services are placed inside the kernel, they have a single address space.

slow execution.
fast execution.

More Secure (Even if one service crashes, others can function properly because of separation)
Less Secure (If one service fails, entire system crashes)
