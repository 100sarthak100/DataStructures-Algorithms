Graph Coloring Problem -
Vertex Coloring - find a way of coloring the vertices of a graph such that no 
                    two adjacent vertices are colored using same color
Edge Coloring - No vertex is incident to two edges of same color
Face Coloring - (Geographical Map Coloring) can be transformed into vertex coloring.

Chromatic Number: The smallest number of colors needed to color a graph G is 
called its chromatic number

Applications of Graph Coloring:
Making schedule or time table - This problem can be represented as a graph where 
every vertex is a subject and an edge between two vertices mean there is a common 
student. So this is a graph coloring problem where minimum number of time slots is 
equal to the chromatic number of the graph.

Register Allocation: In compiler optimization, register allocation is the process 
of assigning a large number of target program variables onto a small number of CPU registers. 
This problem is also a graph coloring problem.
Bipartite Graphs: We can check if a graph is Bipartite or not by coloring the graph using 
two colors. If a given graph is 2-colorable, then it is Bipartite, otherwise not.

Hamiltonian Path in an undirected graph is a path that visits each vertex exactly 
once. A Hamiltonian cycle (or Hamiltonian circuit) is a Hamiltonian Path such that 
there is an edge (in the graph) from the last vertex to the first vertex of the 
Hamiltonian Path.
